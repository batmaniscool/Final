            <h1>The Raven</h1>
            <h5>BY EDGAR ALLAN POE</h5>
            <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
               Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
               While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
               As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
               “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
               Only this and nothing more.”</p>
            <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
               And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
               Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
               From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
               For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
               Nameless here for evermore.</p>
            <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
               Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
               So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
               “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
               Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
               This it is and nothing more.” </p>          
            <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
               “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
               But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
               And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
               That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
               Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
            <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
               Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
               But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
               And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”
               This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
               Merely this and nothing more.</p>
            <p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
               Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
               “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
               Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
               Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
               ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</p>
            <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
               In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
               Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
               But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
               Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
               Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
            <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
               By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
               “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
               Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
               Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
               Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
